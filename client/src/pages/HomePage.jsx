            Maidenhead Town Bowls Club is situated in quiet parkland in Oaken Grove Park,
            with the benefit of ample free parking. We are a friendly, sociable club,
            where visitors and new members can be assured of a warm welcome.
            A number of social events are held during the season, including BBQâ€™s,
            Race Nights, Quizzes and a Club Night each week where all members are
            encouraged to bowl and partake of Fish and Chips or other culinary delights.

                We have a large Club House with a well stocked bar and a kitchen where coffee
                and tea can be prepared at any time.  The kitchen also caters for some of our
                  home games and loan events,  by providing a much acclaimed two-course meal.

                The Green is enclosed by a beech hedge providing privacy and shelter from
                the elements.â€‹ Amongst the pretty gardens around the Green are ample viewing
                  areas and if the weather is a bit chilly a very nice comfy seating area
                  inside, where a drink can be enjoyed from the bar or coffee/tea from the kitchen.
